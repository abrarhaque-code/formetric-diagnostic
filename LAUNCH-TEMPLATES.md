Title: Launched a financial analytics tool specifically for wellness brands - here's what I learned

Hey r/entrepreneur!

I just launched Formetric after 6 months of development, and wanted to share some insights from building a niche SaaS platform.

**Background:**
After helping 100+ wellness entrepreneurs, I realized they needed financial tools that actually understood their industry. Generic business advice often hurts wellness businesses more than it helps.

**What We Built:**
Financial analytics platform specifically for health & wellness brands. Launched with a free diagnostic that provides industry-specific insights in 5 minutes.

**Key Learnings:**

1. **Niche > Generic:** Focusing exclusively on wellness allowed us to provide 10x more relevant insights than generic tools

2. **Educational Value is Key:** Our approach focuses on providing honest assessment without false benchmarking or unsupported claims

3. **Industry Expertise Matters:** Having worked in the space was crucial for understanding unique challenges like seasonal demand and compliance costs

**Educational Approach:**
- Assessment completions growing steadily
- Focus on providing honest value
- Practical recommendations without false claims
- Featured on [publications/platforms]

**What's Working:**
- Industry-specific messaging resonates strongly
- Free diagnostic creates immediate value
- Focus on educational value and honest assessments

**Challenges:**
- Explaining why wellness needs different tools
- Balancing free value with monetization
- Managing demand surge (good problem!)

**For Fellow Entrepreneurs:**
If you're considering a niche approach, I'd encourage it. Yes, the market is smaller, but the fit is so much better that conversion rates are 3x higher than generic tools.

Happy to answer questions about niche SaaS, the wellness industry, or the launch process!

The diagnostic is free during launch: [link]

**Edit:** Thanks for all the questions! I'll keep responding throughout the day.
